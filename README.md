Data wrangling and cleaning of Nigerian market price and transaction datasets using Pandas and NumPy.
# Advanced Data Wrangling for Nigerian Market Forecasting

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, wrangling, and preparing Nigerian market data for forecasting purposes. Two real-world datasets containing market prices and transaction records were cleaned, merged, and reshaped using Python.

## 📂 Datasets
- `nigerian_market_prices.csv`: Contains product price information across different markets and dates.
- `nigerian_market_transactions.csv`: Contains transaction-level data including quantities sold and transaction dates.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Google Colab

## 🔄 Data Wrangling Steps
1. Imported and inspected both datasets
2. Handled missing values and inconsistent data types
3. Removed duplicates and standardized column names
4. Merged transaction and price datasets
5. Reshaped and aggregated data for forecasting readiness

## 📈 Output
- Cleaned and merged dataset ready for time-series forecasting
- Jupyter Notebook documenting the full wrangling process

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Upload or mount Google Drive containing the datasets
3. Run all cells sequentially
